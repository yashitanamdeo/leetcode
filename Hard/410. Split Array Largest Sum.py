            # to be part of some subarray, the smallest we can go is by taking the largest element
            # in a subarray by itself
            ## maximum possible result - sum of all elements in the array since we cannot form
            # a subarray larger than the array itself

                # If it does, we can discard all values to the right of this in our search space since we have
                # something better than those already. We only need to search values to the left to see if 
                # we can find something better
